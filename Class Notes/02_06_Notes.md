### The Frontier (The Wild Wild West)
- Frederick Jackson Turner's *The Frontier Thesis*
  - competing ideas of progress and civilization vs primitiveness and savagery
  - Westward migration was comprised of waves of civilation that would ovetake the savagery of the west
  - "Bald Ango-Saxan Chauvinism"
  - Held sway for most of the 20th Century and affects how it is taught today.
  - Gave way to "American Destiny"
  - Started the simple mythology of the American West when it was really much more complex.

### Who Controlled The West
- Native Americans were not dying off completely
  - in fact they dominated the West
  - .25 million folks were in the American West
  - Comanches controlled West Texas into the 19th Century
- Cattle Drives drove right through the Commanche empire
- Many indigenous groups controlled areas West of the Missippi River
- Many groups were fierce rivals with one and another
- Distinct poltical entities
- US Starts to buy a bunch of land
- Railroads are central to the culture of this era
- Greater numbers of Americans decided to follow the railroads
  - driven by possibilities of great wealth or land
- None of the migration would've been possible without the military clearing out the West for them
  - during and after the Civil War and the Gilded Age, the US Govt was consumed with several synchronous wars in the last several decades of the 19th Century.
- The Govt forced native peoples onto reservations
  - regardless of perspective: change is constant amongst all views

### White American Migrants to the West
- White migrants from the Northeast to the Midwest plus people from Europe.
  - lured by "get rich quick" schemes and money ventures
  - drawn by religious tolerance
  - were also able to spread the word of God
  - The Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints moves to the Utah territory
- Most of the people were going to get Land
- Fed Govt supported the zeal for Land with the Homestead Act
  - Male Citizens could claim a 160 acre plot
  - work on it and apply for an actual deed 5 years later
  - Because people needed a family to run the farms, most of the families in the west had traditional family structures
  - This is how white families found their generational wealth that would be passed down for years to come.
- Homestead Act was kind of a fraud
  - Railroads bought land too
  - Govt also gave Railroads 175 million of acres of land
    - that's more land than Texas
  - Transcontinental Railroad 1869 cost the US govt an insane amount of money
  - Huge profits for investors but also huge deficit for the govt investors
  - Panics of 1873 and 1893 (economic recessions) were caused by the mistakes in the Railroad company
  - by 1880 they had 400,000 men working on the railroads (dangerous and low payed wages)
- Nearly 100,000 people migrate to the Rockies for the sake of precious metals.
  - Many ended up staying rather than going back home.
- Women worked in shops, boarding houses, saloons, and brothels
- people who made it rich spent their money into the Western towns they found the gold in.
- Money could be made by supplying factories in the East
- Factories desired the tough leather of Bison
  - led to near extermination of Bison, thereby raising the importance of cattle.
- Bison *skulls* (no joke) was used to make fertilizer...
- Native Americans didn't kill the Bison, White Americans did...

### Chinese Immigration in the West
- dates back to pre-Civil War Era to the Gold Rush where Chines immigrants arrived in San Francisco
  - due to high taxes after the Opium Wars
- Railroad companies exploited Chinese immigrants 
  - Chinese laborers sought to use union tactics but companies broke their strikes and literally starved them into submission
- Chinese immigrants continued to arrive and worked low-paying jobs
  - Created OG China Town
- Most Chinese Migrants would provide most of labor force of Railroad Laborforce for the railroads
- Railroad companies preferred Chinese migrants because they "worked harder, made fewer demands, and complained less than white workers"
  - This was only true because of the truths of being a racial minority
  - companies completely exploited Chinese Workers
  - Use of TnT to blow through mountains.
- Almost immediately upon arrival in the mid-nineteenth-century Chinese immigrants, opposition to their existance would arise.
  - Racism was quickly codified in California
  - White anger over wages and jobs
  - Poor whites felt that Chinese laborers took down jobs and wages.
  - 1882: Congress responses to pressure and passes the Chinese exclusion act which halted immigration to the US
    - first significant law that restricted immigration into the United States
    - placed restructions on Chinese families that were already in the country
    - Chinese could not be granted citizenships and could still be easily deported
    - not until 1943 until these exclusion acts are repealed
  
### Black Southerners Migration into the West
- The Great Migration didn't start out by going to the North but to the West

- The Exodusters
  - Benjamin Pap Singleton

  - group of 200 Black southerners who migrated to rural Kansas
    - Kansas offered farm land which was unencumberd by Jim Crow Politics
  - Black Migration blocked by legal and extralegal means:
    - Southern govt began literally blocking the exit
    - White people were afraid of losing the region's main labor force
    - White people were both afraid of gaining people in the labor force but also losing the labor force
    - Slow Migration because of the blocks
    - Millions of Black southerners leave to the North instead
- Buffalo Soldiers
  - Black troops stationed in the west to fight native groups and protect White Settlers
  - "Famous Indian Fighters"
  - Participated in significant wars

### Mexican Residents of the 19th Century West
- Not migrants but residents
- US acquisition of large portions of the Southwest and West in the mid 19th century
- Sparsely populated well into the 19th century
- After US victory in the Mexican American War
  - Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo gave Mexicans 1 year to chose to either remain or head back home
  - Treaty was supposed to guarentee safety and property rights of all American Citizens
  - But new territories were far from the federal govt, so this safety was not reinforced
  - Mexican Americans were stripped of their land and experienced racial violence
    - Lynching, Texas Rangers would commit acts of violence, Raids on Business and Homes, Violence against Mexican Farmers due to clashes between Military and Native peoples
