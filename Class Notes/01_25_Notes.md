### Homework
<important> - Weekly Reflection due 1/27/2023 at 11:59pm

### American Women Seek Greater Rights and Political Participation During Reconstruction
- Not a new thing-antebellum women's rights and work in abolition(multi-racial work)
- Push for unversal suffrage-American Equal Rights Association
- Women were willing to side with White Supremacists to get Women's Suffrage
- Disagreements over privilaging Black male suffrage over universal
  - Female White Suffragists were willing to ditch Black American Suffrage for their own suffrage
  - Split the women's suffrage movement, limiting its power and success for generations
- Southern white women pruseue political participation through **Ladies Memorial Associations**
  - Social groups that allow women to influence the way that our history and landscape interacted with
  - important in instating Confederate Monuments
  - Supported Textbooks that printed the **Lost Cause Ideology and Narrative**
  - This is how women supported the public through more subtle means than poltics.
- Black Women founded their own associations that become immensely influential in the Civil Rights Movement
  - These organizations, while not as famous, were just as important
- _Rage and Violence followed and defined the Reconstruction_

###  Racial Terror during the Reconstruction
- Riots
  - Race riots in places like Memphis and New Orleans
    - Countless Homes, schools, churches, where burned and majority were owned by Black Residents
- Interpersonal fights
  - Contract and etiquette disputes
    - Not tipping hat or making way for other people
  - One of the jobs of the Freedman's Bureau (Established by Congress in 1865) was to help with these, but these fights were often not reported or prosecuted
    - Had a register of 1000 murders in just one year and all the reasons were immensely stupid and just forms of etiquette disputes.
- Vigilante Groups (terrorists)
  - Most famous: Klu Klux Klan
    - Goes away and comes back again
  - Not a single, central organiation, but rather many local groups
  - Purposeful and targeted violence
    - Terrorized voting polls, churches, schools, homes
    - Torture, whipping, rape, murder
  - Spread fear among Black Sotherners, limited voting, obstructed Republican Governments
  - Common Goal of restoring white supremacy
- Enforcement Acts helped quell the violence for short period of time.
- White southerners argued racial violence was a *"natural response"* or *"outgrowth"* of Black voting and rights
- Also targeted **White Allies** _(people who helped African Americans)_
- Tried to reinstate Black Americans as the labor class
- Tried to drive the Republicans away from the South

### A Regional Continuity and Change during Reconstruction
- Agriculture remains the core of Southern Economy, as does Black Labor
  - No longer slave labor, but new forms of exploitative labor arise after abolition
- Rise of the systems of sharecropping and tenant farming
  - Laborers did not own land or equipment, and were required to provide a share of the crop to the white owner as a form of "paying" rent.
  - This system dominated agriculture
  - This happened in a time where the price of cotton was plummetting
  - Gave Black Americans some semblance of freedom
  - Often, however, this ended up with Black Americans remaining in constant debt to their white land owners due to the materials they rented and the rent of the land.
  - It just so happens that the person who collected the rent was their former slave owners.
- Created cycles of poverty for many southerners, Black as well as white
  - Also kept the sourthern economy dependeent on cotton (which was extremely volatile on the wold market)
- New form of slavery...?

### A National Change and Continuity During Reconstruction
- Homestead Act: between 1868 and 1934, around 250 million acres of land in the US West granted to individual Americans (virtually for free).
  - Nearly 10% of all land in US
  - People needed to file two small papers with small fees and promise to maintain upkeep on that land
- Well over 1.5 million white families (American-born and immigrant) recieved land
  - Basis for capital and wealth for these families.
  - Through practice, excluded Black families
    - Only 4-5,000 Black families received final land patents through the regional version of the Act
- Act was the most extensive redistribution of land in American History
  - Adult descendents of the orignal Homestead Act in the 2000s: 46 million people
  - Much of white wealth is traced back to this act
    - But what about the poverty of Black people due to this act.

### The End of Reconstruction
- Economic Problems and the Panic of 1873
  - mainly caused by railroad speculation
  - affected North and South
  - caused uptick of violence against Black Americans in the north
- White Northerners find themselves unemployed
  - blamed the federal government's focus on the south
  - blamed President Grant
  - Grant did experience several corruption scandals
- Public support for Reconstruction faded
  - Republicans turned from social issues to economic issues
  - Democrats took over the South and called themselves the Redeemers
    - Focused on Home Rule
      - White Southerners should be in charge of the South
    - called the Redemption
- Compromise of 1877

### Defining Issues
- How do we rebuild a broken nation and what will it look like?
- Fight for Civil Rights (Black Americans and White Allies)
- Westward Expansion & white families accumulating land(at the cost of who?)
- How do you heal the rift between North and South
- Military Reconstruction
- Issue of capital and labor
- How do we protect Free Black Southerners
- Expansion of Federal Power
- Federal Laws fail regionally and locally
- Continued and Immense Racial Violence
- Trying to find a person or peoples to blame for their problems
- Development of Lost Cause Movement
