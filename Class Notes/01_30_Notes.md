# The Gilded Age
 - Comes from [Mark Twain's The Gilded Age Satirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gilded_Age:_A_Tale_of_Today) Work
   - Every evil masked by gold layer of lies
- Era of industry and monopolies
- Extreme explosion of economy
- More money for the rich and less money for the poor
- Severe lingering problems in poverty, working conditions poor, severe income inequality
- Massive political corruption
- Serious issues with U.S. Economy (especially in the South)

### Labor, Capitol, and Government
- Economic strife with the ending of Reconstruction
- The Great Upheaval of the Railroad Strikes of 1877
- The Labor (employees) vs The Capitol (employers) vs the Government (local, state, and federal)
- Established Capitalism as the de facto economy of the U.S.


### How did Industrialization happen so quickly?
- Transition from US as an agricultural society to one based on manufacturing.
- Unskilled Labor
  - More Worker, working more
  - increased efficiency and production
- Severe lack of investment in workers and working conditions
- This only really happened because of the mistreatment of people
- Industrialization did not require artisans but cheap and simple labor
- Only worked because of Westward Migration and Immigration
- Growth of a National Market and the Infrastructure to support it
- Federal Government heavily supported the increase of industry and business
  - New laws to protect investors
- Huge profits for owners and low wages for workers
- All of these establish Capitalism as part of the American Way.

### Capitalism
- a form of economic organization where the means of production and distribution are privately owned and where, ir order to generate profits, individuals make decisions to deploy capital in response to market forces and prices of goods and services
- Not natural or inevitable.
- Capitalism was manufactured not a natural progression of economy.

### Growth of Big Business and The Wealth Gap
- corporations and monopolies
- Before 1904 a few companies had like complete monopolies over the economy
- top 10% owned over 1/4th of the nation's assets
- This will only increase
- Elites used science and philosophy to justify their extreme wealth and social position.
  - Used Darwin's Survival of the Fittest
  - Argued that inequality as a positive thing.
  - Social Welfare created Survival of the Weakest and should be limited
- These theories were adopted by the elites and the government
- Both parties supported capitol over labor
- The republican party becomes friend to Big Business
  - Republicans were always the business party
  - Imposed Tariffs so that American Consumers would only buy American Goods instead of imports
    - But the govt tried to stay out of the economy

### Labor Movements
- workers dealt with unfair contracts, poverty, dire working conditions
- Dealt with this with unions and strikes (like the **Knights of Labor**)
  - people wanted higher wages
  - shorter hours
  - and better working conditions
- Showed workers that teaming up together can get stuff done.
  - Was also a super inclusive movement
- Capital and Government Teamed up to fight against the workers.
- Many laborers were immigrants and this conflict reflected the power struggle and racism still part of America.
- Strikes could be effective or lead to violence
  - Most violence came from people who don't want strikes to happen.
- Changing public opinions of Unions:
  - What was once thought to be a heroic "David vs Goliath" epic
  - To a more violent extremist perspective
  - Labor Unions were associated with violent radicalism
  - [Hay Market Riot in Chicago](https://www.history.com/topics/19th-century/haymarket-riot)
- *Yellow Journalism* - eye catching headlines owned by elites
- 8hr Workday would not come true till the 1940s

### The Populist Movement
- American agriculture was in a dangerous position due to industry
- Farmers aligned under the Farmers Alliance banner to fight Big Business
- Tried to create a third political party to challenge the Two Party System
  - Omaha Platform
- Attracted farmers and those seeking economic reform ("A fight for justice!!")
- Populist rhetoric demonized elites and romanticized the individuals
- Wanted more power to the Fed to regulate the economy
- Fought for direct election of Senators
- Fought for Secret Ballot
- Fought for graduated Income Tax
- Were also racist...yikes...

### Urbanization and Immigration during the Gilded Age
- by 1930s majority of America lived in urban cities
- Noise, slums, traffic jams, pollution
- Mass Transit
- Sky Scrapers
- People flood into cities
- 1880 - 1890: 40% of towns lose population
- increasing migration from South to North
- Millions of African Americans leave the South to the North
- Migrations from Over Seas came as well
- 1870 - 1920: 25 million immigrants came
- 1890: 40% of cities were foreign born immigrants
- Italians, Germans, Irish all came
- Many immigrants would encourage families to join them (**Chain Migration**)
- Why did they immigrate:
  - better land?
  - better rights?
  - better places to live?
- Biggest Pull Factor: immigrants wanted work from industrial jobs and cities
- Immigrants would try to make US a home
  - Assimilation with general populace or Resistance or Something in Between
  - Created ethnic enclaves and neighborhoods within cities
  - immigrants faced xenophobia, prejudice, and awful living/working conditions
