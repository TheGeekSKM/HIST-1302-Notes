### Changes in American Christianity
- Protestant Theologian vs Theologian
- Split in American Christianity during the early 20th Century
- Modernists and the Fundametalists
- Modernists:
  - Contemporary Christianity needs to be intertwined with science and the secular world
  - The bible must be understood as a series of metaphors and allegories rather than realistic historical events
  - Christians need to build a kingdom of God by working against social inequality and save society vs saving individual souls
  - Read and used the Bible as a means to improve the world
- Fundamentalists:
  - Conservatives
  - The Fundamentals was published to combat Modernists arguments
  - Christian faiths should be based on the literal truths
  - Bible was the inerrant word of God
  - Against the Social Gospel Movement
  - Christianity was about saving individual souls
  - Christnan Fundamentals argued that social change needed to be combatted
  - Against science
  - Against sexual exploration, against more freedoms, against progressive movements
  - racist piece of shits
- At the same time the Bible Belt was being created
- The split have different views about their religion
  - it also reflects the broader culture war
- Culture War:
  - which ideas should be more prevalent
  - whose ideology is dominant
  - happens during times of fierce divisiveness
  - associated with the 1960s and 70s

### Scopes Trial (1925)
- Origin of conflict a group is going to intentially prod and poke at a law or act to challenge it
- May 4th, 1925 runs an item noting that the American Civil Liberties Union or ACLU is looking for teacher to challenge the Butler Act
- One day later, a group of town leaders read the ACLU search and hatch a plan to bring the case to Dayton
- Scheme for Dayton publicity
- So they asked John Scopes to bring the case to trial even though he only taught Biology as a substitute teacher
- Was only meant to be a Test Case for the Butler Act
- Reasons Why People Opposed Butler Act:
  - science
  - academic freedom
  - personal liberty
  - parental rights
  - moral responsibilities of educators
- Americans across the nation tuned into the Scopes Trial or the **Trial of the Century**
- "The theory of evolution would eliminate love and make man animalistic"
- The other side did something smart and called Bryan (side of the butler act) as an expert witness and came across as a blundering idiot in the questioning
- Scopes was determined guilty only for the case to be thrown out on a technicality
- Butler Act was repealed in 1973
- Even though Fundamentalists won the court case, they went underground and slowly built a subculture and political presence would remerge in a few decades as a much more powerful group
- Modernity vs. Tradition would come back in a much more powerful Culture war in the 1970s and 80s
- Scopes Trial makes clear that the 1920s that we remember is different than the one that truly existed.
