<important> - Week 4 Reflection (due 02/10)


### Indian Wars from American Perspective
- rid the west of Indian people and open the way for white americans and capitalism
- either forcibly relocate or exterminte
- mostly took play on the area known as the plains
  - really the last larea where Indian groups were living independently
- battles were actually taking place during civil war
  - Union army vs Native peoples
  - same war tactics used in famous Civil War campaigns
- most of the battles were different because they were intermittent, local, and brief

### WHY?
- why was there a need to remove native people from land
1. American Capitalism
   1. Especially Railroads
   2. govt gave away about 10% of entire country to railroad companies so they had to protect the money they invested
2. these projects along with the discovery of the gold in the west would force a showdown between US and independent Native nations
3. railroad lines laid in 19th century damaged Native poeple's economy and lives
4. they interfered by killing railroad workers and halted production
5. the bison was being hunted for either sport or clothing for eastern US capitalism
   1. ended up aiding in the destruction and near extinction of bison
   2. army soldiers were told to kill bison
   3. would clear land by making Natives starve and undermining Native economies that relied on bison
6. 100,000 American migrants were arriving in the West that needed to be protected
   1. Indigenous lives in the west involved movement and nomadic lifestyles
   2. incompatible with the American way
7. US settled tensions between migrants and Natives by using reservations

### Early Confrontations
- Early as 1862, the Dakota Sioux had their patience eroded
  - migrants and white poeple turned their hunting ground into farming land
  - Some of the Sioux tried to emulate them only to find poverty and starvation
  - Pushed to the breaking point, the Sioux chose war over famine
  - led to 6 weeks of war in Southern Minnesota
  - 70-100 Sioux died and 600 Americans died
- While US Military broke the resistance, the deaths of so many American civillians caused uproar that could only be satiated by blood
  - Lincoln ordered the execution for 303 Native peoples
    - most were pardoned or died in prison
    - others were executed
    - larged execution in US History
- 6500 Sioux in Minnesota, no more than 1000 actually fought in war but entire community ended up suffering greatly
- April 1863 rest of Sioux in Minnesota are expelled and their reservations were abolished
- More than 1/4 of Sioux that surrendered died in the following year while in these smaller reservations
- To the south in Colorado, people worried about Native raids
  - wanted Natives to sign treaties that would push them on to reservations
  - One of the chiefs arranged peace talks
  - White settler's anxiety had been multiplied by sensationalist accounts which labeled all Native people as savage
  - Nearly 700 Us army volunteer soldiers attacked Sand Creek village
  - Black Kettle, the Cheyenne Chief was promised safety on his village
    - but that promise was a fucking lie
  - The colorado volunteers surrounded sand creek
  - Black Kettle raise an American flag but that was ignored
  - the regiment descended killing 230 Natives (women, children, and the elderly)
  - This massacre spread to other Native groups and this encouraged Sioux warriers to ambush a group of warriors and settlers and there was not a single survivor
    - bodies were mutilated
    - common theme in the Indian Wars: brutality
    - on both sides
- American demands and action to rid Native people of their home land caused this to happen
- Red Cloud Chief and US agreed to Fort Laramie Treaty which brought temporary peace
  - Huge Native Victory

### 1868 Indian Peace Commission
- sought to reform federal government's Indian policies
- 3 main objectives:
  - remove, if possible, the causes of war
  - to secure our frontier settlements and safe building of railroads
  - suggest or inaugurate some plan of civilization
- What does this mean:
  - remove the presence of Native people
  - remove the presence of Native people
  - reservations and forced assimilation
- Needless to say this was stupid
- developed into a religious and cultural policy
- Missionaries and reformers were supportive of this effort
- tried to convert the Natives
- It was believed that through assimilation, native people could be brought into American society
- The thought was that the Indian Problem would disappear with the force of American protestanism and values rather than guns
- How would they do this?
  - remove land from communal tribal ownership
  - introduce American idea of Male Heads of Household to own land
  - conversion of women's work from in the fields into work in the home
  - women were expected to be pious, chased, and domesticated
  - Native women, like most women, don't actually fit this ideal
  - But they would be "encouraged"
  - Children would attend reservation schools
  - they could not use their own names and practice their own religion
  - schools are why so many native languages have been lost to time
  - Children would be given new Anglo American names, clothing, haircuts, etc.
  - Schools are a crucial part of the Americanizing process
  - left a rather devastating legacy
  - people are now revitalizing "dead" Native languages
- There was some genuine desire-maybe-to improve the lives of the Natives in the west
  - Only because of the white settlers in the first place
- Assimilation is definitely more humane than warefare,
  - but they're both fucking stupid
- Much of the American public was also equally as racist and stupid
- Public wanted to use force because they were stupid

### Resisting Reservations and Assimilation
- mainly Natives would resist the assimilation
- some like Commanche bands refused to settle
- led to the Red River War
  - both sides fought hard and ended with US victory
  - Commanche would be forced onto reservations
- Indian territory would be drastically reduced due to new US states
- Native peoples would constantly be compressed into smaller and smaller pieces of land
- North of Oklahoma, the Sioux still hadn't given up
  - Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse lead Non-Treaty Indians who believed the treaties other poeple were signing would never be honored
    - Based as fuck
- Gold was found in Black Hills
  - US renegs on agreement
  - Who would've thunk it
- Battle of Little Big horn
  - death of LT cournal George Armstrong Custard
- 1881 Natives finally laid down their weapons
- It was this Mythic Photo that was completely stupid and dumb
  - Custer was built up as this hero that resisted "to the last bullet and last cartridge"
  - Custer's Last Stand
  - Custer was actually not as glorious
  - 210 strong battalion just absolutely got shit on
- The Amercan 100 Centennial would celebrate this bullshit
- Americans made custer a hero because they would looking for one.
- The first legal justification for removal was the Indian Removal Act of 1830
